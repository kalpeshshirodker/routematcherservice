# RouteMatchService
Provide url fragment matching capability which can be used for routing based on fragment changes. By default angular router doesnt support routing based on url fragment. The service allows the user to define routes, so that the application can navigate based on fragment changes. 

For instance, we can define a route to load a component for creating a new object, when the url provided contains e.g. `<appurl>/states/#new`
